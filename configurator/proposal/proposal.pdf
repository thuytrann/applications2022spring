Configurator Proposal
Object:
Perfume Configurator
Need:
I think a configurator for a perfume, in which a person can customize their perfumeâ€™s top notes, heart notes, and base notes. Within those notes, the user can have the option of fresh, floral, fruit, spice, wood, or musk notes. There will also be an option of engravement on the bottle to add a special touch to this personal experience. 
Research Intention:
It is important to look at all the different scents out there to create a configurator with the most variety. I can also do interviews, research to find the most popular scents out there to recommend for a user. 
Final Deliverable: 
I am planning on making a mobile app to navigate a user through the process of creating their personal scent within 3 minutes. There will also be an option of posting your own customized scents to other users on the platform and other users can purchase that specific concoction if they want.
